# Reinforcement Learning: Double Q Learning with Doom

This repository showcases a from-scratch implementation of a Double Deep Q Network which undergoes reinforcement learning in order to play a Doom level.

Admittedly, some aspects of the code are crude; but the author intends for this project not only as a functional implementation, but more as an educational introduction resource into deep q reinforcement learning.

In this repository, you will find three files apart from this markdown document. `Full Code.ipynb` is the full, uncommented code used to generate and train the model. `RL Doom.pdf` is the educational resource: the author walks through the logic behind Deep Q Learning and motivates some of the improvements, like frame stacking and memory replay. Finally, `Training Result.mp4` is a 1-second long demo video of the trained agent playing Doom.
